  The default firmware does not support Classic Bluetooth commands. For how to enable support for those commands, please refer to :ref:`Introduction to Classic Bluetooth <cmd-bt-intro>`.

Establish SPP connection between phone (or PC) and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} in Normal Transmission mode with IO capability set to NoInputNoOutput
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, mobile phone or PC is master and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is slave. The example shows how to establish SPP connection.

#. Classic Bluetooth initialization.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTINIT=1

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Classic Bluetooth SPP profile initialization, and the role is set to slave.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPINIT=2

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Set Classic Bluetooth device name.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTNAME="EXAMPLE"

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Set Classic Bluetooth scan mode to discoverable and connectable.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSCANMODE=2

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Set Classic Bluetooth security parameters. Set ``io_cap`` to ``NoInputNoOutput``, ``pin_type`` to ``fixed``, ``pin_code`` to ``9527``.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSECPARAM=3,1,"9527"

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Start Classic Bluetooth SPP profile.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPSTART

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. The mobile phone or PC initiates the connection.

   The mobile phone or PC should be able to find the Bluetooth device with name "EXAMPLE". If the mobile phone or PC initiates a connection and the connection is established successfully, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will prompt:

   .. code-block:: none

     +BTSPPCONN:0,"e0:24:81:47:90:bc"

   Note:

   - The address you obtained may be different from that in the above response.

#. Send 4 bytes of data.

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPSEND=0,4

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     >

   The symbol ``>`` indicates that AT is ready for receiving serial data and you can enter data now. When the requirement of data length determined by the parameter ``<data_len>`` is met, the writing starts.

   Input 4 bytes, for example, ``test``, then AT will respond the following message.

   .. code-block:: none

     OK

   Note:

   - If the number of bytes inputted are more than the length (n) set by ``AT+BTSPPSEND``, the system will reply ``busy p...``, and send the first n bytes. And after sending the first n bytes, the system will reply ``OK``.
   - After AT outputs the ``>`` character, the special characters in the data does not need to be escaped through the escape character, and it does not need to end with a new line (CR-LF).

#. Receive 4 bytes of data.

   Assume that mobile phone or PC sends 4 bytes of data (data is ``test``), the system will prompt:

   .. code-block:: none

     +BTDATA:4,test

#. Terminate Classic Bluetooth SPP connection.

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPDISCONN=0

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     +BTSPPDISCONN:0,"e0:24:81:47:90:bc"

     OK

   Note:

   - The address you obtained may be different from that in the above response.

Establish SPP connection between phone (or PC) and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} in Passthrough mode with IO capability set to NoInputNoOutput
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, mobile phone or PC is master and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is slave. The example shows how to establish SPP connection.

#. Classic Bluetooth initialization.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTINIT=1

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Classic Bluetooth SPP profile initialization, and the role is set to slave.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPINIT=2

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Set Classic Bluetooth device name.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTNAME="EXAMPLE"

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Set Classic Bluetooth scan mode to discoverable and connectable.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSCANMODE=2

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Set Classic Bluetooth security parameters. Set ``io_cap`` to ``NoInputNoOutput``, ``pin_type`` to ``fixed``, ``pin_code`` to ``9527``.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSECPARAM=3,1,"9527"

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Start Classic Bluetooth SPP profile.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPSTART

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. The mobile phone or PC initiates the connection.

   The mobile phone or PC should be able to find the Bluetooth device with name "EXAMPLE". If the mobile phone or PC initiates a connection and the connection is established successfully, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will prompt:

   .. code-block:: none

     +BTSPPCONN:0,"e0:24:81:47:90:bc"

   Note:

   - The address you obtained may be different from that in the above response.

#. Send data in Passthrough Mode.

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPSEND

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     OK

     >

   This response indicates that AT has entered Passthrough Mode.

   Note:

   - After the AT enters Passthrough Mode, data received from serial port will be transmitted to the mobile phone or PC.

#. Stop sending data.

   When receiving a packet that contains only ``+++``, the Passthrough Mode will be stopped. Then please wait at least 1 second before sending next AT command. Please be noted that if you input ``+++`` directly by typing, the ``+++`` may not be recognised as three consecutive ``+`` because of the prolonged typing duration. For more details, please refer to :ref:`AT+BTSPPSEND <cmd-BTSPPSEND>`.

   .. Important::

     The aim of ending the packet with ``+++`` is to exit Passthrough Mode and to accept normal AT commands. However, you can also use command ``AT+BTSPPSEND`` to go back into Passthrough Mode.

#. Terminate Classic Bluetooth SPP connection.

   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPDISCONN=0

   Response:

   .. code-block:: none

     +BTSPPDISCONN:0,"e0:24:81:47:90:bc"

     OK

   Note:

   - The address you obtained may be different from that in the above response.

   Response:
  
   .. code-block:: none

     OK

#. Start Classic Bluetooth SPP profile.
   
   Command:

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTSPPSTART

   Response:

#. The mobile phone or PC initiates the connection.

   The mobile phone or PC can initiate a connection and generate a PIN code, then you can enter the PIN code on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.

   .. code-block:: none

     AT+BTKEYREPLY=0,676572

   If the connection is established successfully, the system will prompt:

   .. code-block:: none

     +BTSPPCONN:0,"e0:24:81:47:90:bc"

   Note:

   - The PIN code you entered may be different from those in the above command. Please use the real PIN instead.

Establish SPP connection between two {IDF_TARGET_NAME} development boards
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is an example of using two {IDF_TARGET_NAME} development boards, one as master, the other one as slave.

.. Important::

  In the following steps, the operations starting with ``Master`` only need to be executed at master, and the operations starting with ``Slave`` only need to be executed at slave. If the operation is not specified on which side it is executed, it needs to be executed on both the master side and the slave side.

Establish A2DP connection and enable A2DP Sink to play music
-------------------------------------------------------------

.. Important::
  
  - To use ``A2DP Sink``, you need to add the code of the ``I2S`` part by yourself. For the code to initialize the ``I2S`` part, please refer to `a2dp sink example <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/examples/bluetooth/bluedroid/classic_bt/a2dp_sink/main/main.c>`__.
  - The driver code of the ``decoder`` chip part also needs to be added by yourself or use an off-the-shelf development board.

#. Classic Bluetooth initialization.
