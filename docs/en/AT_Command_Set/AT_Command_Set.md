ESP-AT Commands Set
=============

Here is a list of AT commands. Some of the AT commands can only work on the ESP32, which will be marked as [ESP32 Only]; others can work on both the ESP8266 and ESP32.

## Appendix 1. [AT Command Description](#Begin-AT)
Each command can support four types of AT commands.

|Type | Command Format | Description|  
|---|---|---|  
|Test Command	 | AT+<x>=? | Queries the Set Commands' internal parameters and their range of values.|
|Query Command | AT+<x>? | Returns the current value of parameters.|
|Set Command | AT+<x>=<â€¦> | Sets the value of user-defined parameters in commands, and runs these commands.|
|Execute Command | AT+<x> | Runs commands with no user-defined parameters.|

 * Not all AT commands support all four variations mentioned above.
 * Square brackets [ ] designate the default value; it is either not required or may not appear.
 * String values need to be included in double quotation marks, for example: `AT+CWSAP="ESP756290","21030826",1,4`.
 * Escape sensitive delimiters is necessary on string parameters in AT command.
   * `\\`: escape backslash itself
   * `\,`: escape comma which used to separate each parameter
   * `\"`: escape double quotation marks which used to mark string input
   * `\<any>`: escape `<any>` character means that drop backslash symbol and only use `<any>` character
   > for example:  
   > `AT+CWJAP="comma\,backslash\\ssid","1234567890"`  
   > `AT+MQTTPUB=0,"topic","\"{\"sensor\":012}\"",1,0`
 * The default baud rate of AT command is 115200.
 * AT commands are ended with a new-line (CR-LF), so the serial tool should be set into "New Line Mode".
 * Definitions of AT command error codes are in `esp-at/components/at/include/esp_at.h`.

## Appendix 2. [AT Commands with Configuration Saved in the Flash](#Begin-AT)
The following AT Commands with configuration will be saved in the flash NVS Area.

 *  [AT+SYSSTORE](#cmd-SYSSTORE): some AT configurations will be saved into flash after command `AT+SYSSTORE=1`.
 *  [AT+UART_DEF](#cmd-UARTD): for example, `AT+UART_DEF=115200,8,1,0,3`
 *  [AT+SAVETRANSLINK](#cmd-SAVET) : for example, `AT+SAVETRANSLINK=1,"192.168.6.10",1001`
 *  [AT+CWAUTOCONN](#cmd-AUTOC): for example, `AT+CWAUTOCONN=1`
